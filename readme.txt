- You have to refactor code in app.js file. Change it, split it, improve it, do it your own way!
- You can use version of node you prefer
- Code was tested in node 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, so it should be quite version agnostic at this stage
- Application should print out the array of parsed events:

[
  { 
    name: 'Chelsea - Arsenal',
    score: '2:1' 
  },
  {
    name: 'Germany - France',
    score: 'Main score: 3:0 (set1 25:23, set2 25:19, set3 25:21)'
  },
  { 
    name: 'Pogoń Szczeciń vs Azoty Puławy',
    score: '34:26'
  },
  { 
    name: 'GKS Tychy - GKS Katowice',
    score: '9:7,2:1,5:3,9:9' 
  },
  {
    name: 'Maria Sharapova vs Serena Williams',
    score: 'Main score: 2:1 (set1 7:6, set2 6:3, set3 6:7)'
  }
]

- Structure of matches data should stay intact (that doesn't mean you can't move it around tho!)
- You can stick to JS, or use TypeScript as well (it is event better, because we mostly work with TS)
- We strongly recommend to write some unit tests!

Good luck!
